# MonteCarlo_R - MTH3028 Statistical Inference Coursework

## Description

Conducted here is a simulation study and comparison of the sampling properties of the Method of Moments (MoM), Bias-Corrected Maximum Likelihood Estimator (BCMLE), and Method of Moments Estimator with Bootstrapping (MoM with Bootstrap) for the distribution. I am simulating multiple datasets using the Monte Carlo method, I estimate the parameters using each estimator function.
